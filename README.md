# Modelling_Evaluation
In this exercise, we will practise model evaluation metrics in R. We will use **cancerdata.csv** dataset adapted from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) to build our model. The aim is to classify  malignant breast cancer patients successfully..
